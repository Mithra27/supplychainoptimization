# Supply Chain Optimization Python Script

Welcome to the Supply Chain Optimization Python Script repository! This script is designed to streamline data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling in the context of supply chain management.

# Overview

This Python script serves as a versatile tool for supply chain data analysis. It enables users to upload datasets, performs exploratory data analysis, generates insightful visualizations, and employs a RandomForestRegressor model for predictive analysis.
